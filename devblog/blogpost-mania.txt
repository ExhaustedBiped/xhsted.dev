In any rhythm game, the notes are kept in a file called a beatmap. Usually, per song, there is a beatmap, a song, and an image, as well as sfx for the song itself. This is especially the case in osu!, where all beatmaps are stored in a similar format to that. As an osu!mania player myself, I wondered if it would be possible to visualize mania beatmaps and play them with accuracy judgement, much the same as the game is. I also wanted to keep the project fairly simple. I wanted to use no more than python, pygame, and some other libraries I would have to write myself. The best bit is: I managed to do so. And, it wasn't too hard either.
